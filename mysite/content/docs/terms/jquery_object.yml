  jQuery's core concept is the [jQuery object](http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jQuery). Entwine operates by extending this
  object, so some understanding of the underlying functionality is needed.

  Each instance of this object has:

    - a set of DOM elements that the instance operates on
    - a set of methods that perform operations on that set

  There are many ways to create instances of this object & add DOM elements to an instance's set of elements. The most
  common method is the [`jQuery` or `$` function](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/), which takes a CSS selector, and returns
  an instance of the jQuery object containing the set of all elements in the active document which match that CSS selector.

  It's important to note that every method of the jQuery object is expected to work on pretty much any element. If
  the method only works on form elements, or input elements, or if it needs to do different things depending on the
  type of element, then that filtering needs to take place inside the method itself.
